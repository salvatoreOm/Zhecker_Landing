# ðŸ”§ GitHub Actions Build Fix

## Issue Identified
GitHub Actions was failing with `vite: not found` because:
1. `npm ci` wasn't installing devDependencies properly in CI environment
2. Build tools (vite, esbuild) were in devDependencies but needed for production build

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Moved Critical Build Tools to Dependencies
- âœ… Moved `vite`, `esbuild`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `typescript` to main dependencies
- âœ… These are now available during the Azure build process

### 2. Created New GitHub Actions Workflow
- âœ… `azure-deploy.yml` - Improved workflow with better dependency handling
- âœ… Uses Node.js 20.x with proper caching
- âœ… Explicitly includes dev dependencies with `npm ci`
- âœ… Verifies build tools are available before building
- âœ… Shows build output for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Build Process
- âœ… Checks vite and esbuild versions before building
- âœ… Lists build outputs for verification
- âœ… Better error handling and logging

## Manual Commands to Deploy Fixed Version

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions build process

- Move critical build tools to main dependencies
- Create improved Azure deployment workflow  
- Fix port configuration for Azure (8080)
- Enhanced build process with better logging"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Results
- âœ… GitHub Actions build will complete successfully
- âœ… All dependencies will be properly installed
- âœ… Build process will generate dist/ folder correctly
- âœ… Azure deployment will use the built application

The new workflow will handle the build process more reliably and deploy to Azure successfully!
